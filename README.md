# Operational KPIs for Meat Trimming Efficiency
Data-Driven Insights from a Meat Processing Facility in the Southern U.S.

## Project summary

This project analyzes operational data from a meat processing plant located in the Southern region of the United States. 
The focus is on evaluating employee performance and labor cost efficiency in the meat trimming process â€” a core task where precision, speed, and cost control are essential.

By calculating and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs), this analysis provides actionable insights for plant managers, operations analysts, and decision-makers looking to optimize labor productivity, reduce waste, and track output trends over time.

## Business context

Meat trimming is a labor-intensive step in the meat processing workflow. Employees manually remove fat, connective tissue, and bone from primal cuts to produce market-ready products such as steaks, roasts, or ground meat.

Given the high cost of labor and the variability of yield by employee, processing plants often monitor:

- Productivity (pounds/hour)
- Cost efficiency (labor cost per pound)
- Monthly output by worker
- Performance variability

These metrics are critical for cost control, workforce planning, and incentive systems in facilities that serve domestic and export markets.

## KPIs implemented

| KPI   | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Average Pounds per Hour  | Measures individual employee productivity  |
| Cost per Pound Trimmed  | Labor cost efficiency metric  |
| Monthly Output per Employee | Total volume processed per worker per month |
| Monthly Cost Efficiency | Total pounds trimmed per dollar spent on labor |
| Performance Variability | Tracks inconsistency in trimming speed across employees |
| Top Performer Identification | Ranks employees by trimming efficiency |
	


## Tableau dashboard

An interactive Tableau Public dashboard has been created to explore the KPIs visually and intuitively.
